# TheShoppers - not changing anything here , 
My first school project
The project entitled, ‚Äú The Shoppers‚Äù undertaken as a part of fulfilment of Computer Science [083] practical syllabus for class XI CBSE under guidance and supervision my teacher Ms. Ravneet Kaur.

This project will enable the medical shops to manage their shops stock, will allow the medical shop staff to know about the stocks of the medicine, add new stock and remove stocks which have expired or been damaged. It
provides detail on the medicines, it‚Äôs price and expiry.
